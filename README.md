This is a small extension to fix one of the most anoying UX problems when using protonmail.com on desktop. 9 times out of 10 when I reply to an email I need to view previous emails in the chain but the popup composer window covers half the email so I have to minimize it every time.

I'm not the only person with this problem as seen from multiple requests for the same feature: https://protonmail.uservoice.com/forums/284483-protonmail?category_id=95563&query=Composer%20window%20dock

### How to use

This extension can be installed as an [unpacked extension on chromium browsers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked).

Contents of the [content-script.js](content-script.js) can be copied to your favorite tool for injecting custom JavaScript to pages.
