This is a small extension to fix one of the most annoying UX problems when using protonmail.com on desktop. 9 times out of 10 when I reply to an email I need to view previous emails in the chain but the popup composer window covers half the email, so I have to minimize it every time.

I'm not the only person with this problem, as seen from multiple requests for the same feature: https://protonmail.uservoice.com/forums/284483-protonmail?category_id=95563&query=Composer%20window%20dock
